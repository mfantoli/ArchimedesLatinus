# Archimedes_Latinus
This repository contains the Gold Standard (GS), created in the context of the project of UD annotation of Jacopo da San Cassiano's Latin translation of Archimedes' Ancient Greek mathematical texts. Texts were provided by Beatrice Sisana (PhD at the Dipartimento di Studi Umanistici, Universit√† di Roma 3). Sisana created a digital edition of Jacopo's text using MauroTex. In this GitHub we share the text extracted from the critical edition of Jacopo's translation of  _The Spirals_ (original_text).
The file training data contains the first 48 sentences of _The Spirals_, while the file test data contains 30 sentences taken from proposition XIX and XX of _The Spirals_. This data were created by correcting an automated output using [UD Annotatrix] (https://maryszmary.github.io/ud-annotatrix/standalone/annotator.html). The data have been used to train and test the [deep biaffine parser] (https://github.com/chantera/biaffineparser).
